Early Access Review
								Having played a lot of Battle Royal in H1Z1 (before they split the game), I can say this game mode is pretty fun. But, it is just ONE game mode. So, ask yourself if it is worth buying a 20€ game for just ONE gamemode, a gamemode previously part of another game!?-----Daybreak claims that they will be adding more gamemodes, but that's yet to be seen. We don't know what gamemodes or how many will be added. Reading the early acces page they claim to add additional gamemodes and game rules. Judging the history of this game/development, I would not be supprised if they only add slight variations of the ONE gamemode Battle Royal.Before the split, there already where 3 variants of this game mode, you had one without zombies, one with zombies and one with special rewards for winning! This last mode was behind a cash wall and you need to buy tickets for real hard cash to join this mode.Technicly they could say they have 3 gamemodes. Then you have the same game with team of 2, or team of 5 players. So there you have it, 5 gamemodes! :PWe have to wait and see what the new gamemodes are, if any are added!Ask yourself, knowing this, is ONE gamemode still worth 20€?-----Let's inform you some more, because this game has a rocky history with many claims that never became reality!They ones claimed to NEVER add pay2win mechanics to this game, then airdrops where added to survival mode that gave you food, water, weapons and ammo! Airdrops are behind a paywall from real hard cash! Though they changed the way this works but still ...They claimed this game would become free2play ones released. Guess what, it's 20€ with additional supply crates and cosmatic microtransactions! Even payed gamemodes like the Battle Royal variant (Green Dawn) and airdrops for ingame loot.Again, ask yourself, is this game worth 20€, with possible new gamemodes behind cash wall, with micro transactions and many broken promises?Then the worst part, the recent split of H1Z1 into two games. This game, King of the Kill, was part of the original H1Z1. You had survival servers and Battle Royal servers! Now you have the survival game, 20€ and the battle royal game for another 20€! And what would happen if say a new gamemode is added to King of the Kill, which becomes very popular, will they split agian? Who knows!?This split would not be the worst of things, if they cut the price in half. Would be fair since they cut the game in half but nope, now you pay 2x20€ for something that ones was 1x20€, for something that ones was promised to be free2play!Also, remember you now need to pay double for microtransactions. Getting a new piece of clothing from a microtransaction was universal availible for all servers and gamemodes. Now, if you want that same piece of clothing be prepared to buy the same item twice!!!Knowing all of this, ask yourself is ONE gamemode worth 20€?-----With this out of the way you might want to know if this ONE gamemode is fun and yes, I said I have lots of fun with this gamemode. So let's get into that!You spawn with around 150 other players on a large open map. Everyone drops down from the sky with a parasute. It's now time to land as fast as you can, so you can be the first to loot weapons, ammo, backpacks and more. So you can be the first to blast others in the face.After a few minutes a savezone is drawn on your map, because toxic fog will be released and slowly drive you towards the savezone. This mechanic is fun and usefull to drive the remaining players towards the same spot.Though there is only ONE map it's big enough to be fun for a long time. Mainly because a lot of things are random. Not the map itself but your spawn location is random, weapon spawns are random and the savezones are random. One match ends in an urban location and another on top of the mountains.All seems good, but there is also a lot wrong with the game and it's mechanics!Spawning for example! You don't spawn at the same time as your enemies. It depends on your loading time, internet connection and random bad luck (sometimes the game takes 2 or 3 times longer to load). This means people with faster hardware and internet connection land faster, getting guns fasters and thus have an increased change to win!Next problem is that hitbox detection and netcode are so random. With a bit of bad luck you can shoot somebody in the head for multiple times without them dieing. While other times you one hit kill them.Same with the shotgun, it's spread pattern is random. So you can almost get sniped from long distance with a shotgun while other times you can't hit/kill somebody at close range! And it's all luck, or badluck depending how it ends!On top of that there aren't many weapons and in the end it comes down to AR15 for long range, shotgun for close range. Perhaps the AK47 (though it got nerved) or if you are lucky the hunting rifle (sniper that only drops from airdrops). All the other weapons are just useless compared to the above, so bows, crossbows and pistols are ignored! You only use them if they are the first weapon you can find early game.-----Eventhough this gamemode is a lot of fun, even with all it's flaws, I can't recommend it to anyone! Specially knowing that this ONE gamemode was part of another game!Perhaps if they fix the core issues (spawning, hitbox detection, etc) and add more gamemodes AND lower the price to 10€ or less, then and only then it might become worth it!For now, it's a big NO NO. Not recommended!			"

												H1Z1 is a dead game, murdered by it’s own developers.I’m not here to demand my money back. This game was once fun a full of promise so I have no problem with the fact that I paid full price for it. You see, that’s how it’s supposed to go. Early access is a kind of a system where gamers support a clearly unfinished product out of the love for games and the developers in turn honor that support by trying to use those funds to better the product as well as they possibly can.This is not what happened with H1Z1.Daybreak noticed way too early that pushing out ridiculous amounts of items gave them a nice extra revenue, not only from crate/key sales but also from gamers juggling those items back and forth at the marketplace (yes, they get a cut).The shift from building an interesting game to building a moneymaking machine was clear as day. Instead of bettering the game, updates concentrated on how to get more players to play → buy crates → buy and sell items. The lack of love is so apparent in the development of this game that it leaves me and all my friends wondering if the developers are actually gamers themselves at all.I got this game very soon after the launch and played regularly over the years. I watched a fun functional game turn into a monotonic mess. Let’s look at the changes / functions closer:Normal Battle Royale:- When the game first got out, it had a good interesting map with a lot of foliage and natural formations. This allowed players to have more than one strategy. This is the only time when the items they sold were useful because you could actually take advantage of things like camo. Soon the developers cut the map’s size, removed almost all the interesting places and pretty much all the foliage. This was no doubt a way to cater to an audience with cheaper computers. The end result is horrible: nothing but open level fields without foliage or even rocks to take cover behind. In a way it looks like a 12 year old’s first attempt at making a map in Unity using nothing but free store assets. The map looks unprofessional and is boring to play in.- Let’s mention this again. There is only 1 map.- Guns used to feel steady. Now the recoil is like everyone is missing an arm. As someone who has handled multiple different firearms in her life I can tell that it doesn’t work like this.- The original way of fighting but also having to worry about the location of the safe zone was more interesting and actually required some brains to do. Now they added all sorts of ease-of-access map markers to make sure anyone with 50IQ or less can just spawn into the safe zone and pew pew pew / repeat.- There’s only one way to play. Because of the emptiness of the map and the safe zone always concentrating on an open level field, the only way to survive is to get a car and keep moving. On foot you never have a place to hide behind and end up being shot down in seconds by someone with a car. This wasn’t the case before, using a car was only one of the multiple ways you could approach winning the match.- Cheaters. This problem got a lot worse after the game went ftp.- Desync.- Annoying things like grenade blasts and gas grenade gas passing walls / floors.- Again, cars. They used to be rare. This was nice because it forced people to play in more than just one way. Now cars are literally everywhere, it takes less than a minute for a 5-person team to have a vehicle for every person.- People don’t play. Trying to play fives after 1AM in EU is borderline impossible because the lobby has less than 5 teams.Car Royale:Note that this would be a really fun mode if it actually worked.- Desync.- Getting stuck on walls / railings.- Duos never available.- Takes forever to start a match.- Impossible to start a match after 1AM due to no-one playing this game.- A griefer’s heaven. Why? There is no vote kick or any way to lock a spot on your team. If you have the misfortune to not actually have 4 people available to play, you are at the mercy of the 1 random person who gets matched with your team forcibly. This one person has a multitude of ways to screw over the team: stealing all healing items, using molotovs to set your own team’s car on fire, using grenades to hurt your own team’s car, using mines to hurt your own team, using the crossbow or the rpg to hurt your own team or (and this is the best part) getting angry over not getting a special weapon like the crossbow and taking the ammo into his own inventory even if someone else has the crossbow. Note that the person who actually has the weapon cannot take the ammo into their own inventory and use it, only the ones without the weapon can take it and make it unavailable for the person who has it. If the randomer ends up as the driver he has plenty of new ways to troll. These people are more common than you’d think and seem to be playing this mode solely for this purpose.- The unwinnable match. If you play 10 matches, about 3-4 out of those matches are unwinnable by default. Not because of the skill of your team but because of the system not registering the destruction of a team if they have a 2000ping ftp player connecting while they died. This leads to you being alone in the safe zone with no-one to kill, yet the system says there is still one person/team alive besides you.- The 2000 ping players. Again, there is no vote kick or any way to get this person off your team. If you play with 2 friends 8 times out of 10 your last team mate is this person. Why is it a problem then? I’ll tell you. After you spawn, you need to change the driver if your team has a person that always drives. But if someone is still connecting, you cannot change the seats. Odds are you end up driving around half the match with the randomer still connecting. Again one of those awesome things brought to us by making the game ftp.- The quality of the player base. I didn’t mention this on the normal Battle Royale because it’s not a bother there but in Car Royale it is. Team games are a great way to meet new gamers like yourself, make friends and hone your teamwork skills. This game has nothing but ftp players left. This means people without steam profiles, microphones, teamwork skills or even the ability to connect into the match.The game has been going downhill for a long time due to many of the reasons I’ve stated above and people have spoken out. Just look at the reviews (even before the game went ftp).And how does Daybreak answer the gamers? By reverting back to the old map? No. By changing the shooting mechanics back to how they used to be? No. They answer by releasing more items. And crates. And hoodies that cost 16 euros. And Weapon skins that cost 10 euros. Daybreak will never get another cent from me. Disrespecting your own game and your player base like this is like disrespecting the entire gamer culture. Gamers can see when a developer develops for the money and not for the love of the game. And this is why this game is dead. Time to move on.			"

 Alright, here we ♥♥♥♥ing goWhat I'll say is just the same perspective you've seen alot around here... just in different words. Basically H1Z1 (the Battle Royale edition, I'll skip the whole game and dev splits in between) was the first battle royale around. People enjoyed it and it was overall a good time. Buggy but alpha and betas exist for a reason, right?Fast forward a bit and PUBG is announced and released and booms the BR market. Later Epic gives a free BR mode to their survival game Fortnite (also in beta, it performs like a charm and was/is extremely enjoyable, still getting updates extremely regularly).While H1 was around and before PUBG was released what did Daybreak (the devs) do?Push out little updates every 4-6 months, such updates that were NOT worthy of the time they took to come out.After PUBG and Fortnite appear what did Daybreak do?Push out big updates (mostly cosmetic) and completely reworking both gun mechanics and vehicle mechanics (which only needed tweaks, not ♥♥♥♥ing reworks) into what is now the 3rd gun mechanic rework that no one ♥♥♥♥ing asked for. This shows H1 could compete in the BR market with the big boys again! Support the game! Hell yeah!Updates that didn't bring anything good to the game, ♥♥♥♥ yea...wait, what?Anyway, couple months later, the unoptimized, cosmetic filled, money grabbing H1Z1 is announced to go out of early access, aiming at a very good perspective for the future of the game, with constant support and updates from the developers.http://steamcommunity.com/games/433850/announcements/detail/1673522637761530036This release was last weekOne week later (yesterday), what I will consider as an ""emergency announcement"" is given by Daybreak:""Guys, H1Z1 is out and our future perspectives dictate that F2P is the way to go. Sorry for the buyers of the fully functional release, you can refund according to steam's refund policy""http://steamcommunity.com/games/433850/announcements/detail/1675775070302263191So get this♥♥♥♥♥♥ The game is out and gets a huge publicity stunt, facebook, media articles, steam banners, etc. It's out! People will buy it more since there is alot of people who only buy the game upon release, Daybreak got a very likely boost in sales. Logic dictates one plays the game once it's bought, and according to steam's refund policy: if you exceed 2 hours of steam play time... the refund is no longer eligible.Do you see where I'm going with this? So they release this (still) unoptimized, broken and ALPHA-STATE WORTHY game and day 7 release the Free to Play announcement and make it F2P THE DAY IT'S ANNOUNCED!! And people who bought it during this week and played little over 2 hours (which is about 4 matches) can't refund it. Excellent!!""Well, I'm sure the compensation for people who bought it is rewarding enough, especially those who were with the game since it's very birth (3 ♥♥♥♥ING YEARS AGO)""We (I mean every buyer with ""We"") got a hat, a shirt (not even good ones), a car camo, 10 of the newest crates (and if you get good valuable items to sell and try to refund your game through this ""plan B"",  you can't sell them cuz...  unmarketable) and 10K skulls (a currency) which allows you to buy about... nothing.One dev said in the community hub ""Hey - we can't control your luck of the day, but at least you have a few other free skins to enjoy!""People must feel so happy they paid 20€ for the final product of their game to be this. Some free skins. Yay.Oh and I mentioned the 10K skulls. So get this, with those skulls, you can buy: about a mix of 3-5 clothing pieces depending on which ones you buy, a car camo or an unlocked crate + 1 skin.Wow, so much value. So much appreciation for all the support, love and suggestions we gave you throughout the game's lifespan, Daybreak.So the grave was set, the nails were locked, they just needed to drop the hammer. F2P dropped the hammer. You compensated your loyal playerbase with ♥♥♥♥-all. You gave F2P users a broken game that barely runs, not even my GTX1060 can run this at 60 FPS at all times. AutoRoyale (their ""innovative"" mode which is essentially the same but locked inside a car) doesn't even hit 60FPS at all.(And before you argue bottleneck I have an i7 7700k)And don't forget. What would F2P users play? A game that is in absolute no way better than Fortnite for the same price... or Fortnite? We get a pistol, 2 AR's, a shotgun, a sniper, an SMG and 2 bows. Some weapons were even removed! Other BR's can get upwards of 15+ weapons!!But wait!You can reward yourself with the Edition Packs! Bronze, Silver and Gold all give skins and crates for you to open and get your mass supply of cool skins!EXCEPT THE PACKS ARE 20, 45 and 93 (NINETY ♥♥♥♥ING THREE) EUROS!!!http://store.steampowered.com/app/820442/H1Z1_Gold_LIMITED_EDITION_Battle_Royale_Pack/LOOK AT THIS ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥T, WOULD YOU PAY 93 EUROS FOR THIS? You can get Witcher 3 COMPLETE GOTY EDITION + Fallout 4 GOTY EDITION FOR THE SAME PRICE. You can buy 3 copies of PUBG for this price!!!!! EDIT: these packs were misteriously removed out of nowhere from the stores. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯And before you insult me for being a self entitled ♥♥♥♥ wanting a refund... I don't want a refund, never did and never will. I can't get anyways, but it's been so long since I bought it, I kind of don't care anymore.I payed 50,99€ for BRINK back in 2011 ON RELEASE. And I DEFENDED it's F2P model introduced in 2017. 6 years vs. 3 years. It honestly doesn't matter. BRINK is a full game. You get the story, multiplayer and skins all for free through the standard play everyone did back in 2011. The DLC's existed since 2012 and are cheap cosmetic aside from Agents of Change.But this... this... there is no middle finger big enough from Daybreak to consumers and from us to them as well. All aboard the big middle finger convention! So, what do you want, then? Not another single soul give this game a try, or even dare to buy a single skin from this game, at all, AT ALL. And for the rest of playerbase let this die by leaving and playing♥♥♥♥♥♥that is actually worth playing, like Fortnite and, even if totally ♥♥♥♥ed up in it's full release, PUBG (which is still miles away better).I won't do the usual Pros and Cons ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, all pros this has are present in PUBG and Fortnite as well. All cons... PUBG and Fortnite have about 20% of such cons, if that many at all.A cashgrab through and through, the biggest slap in the face of the year and that I ever got. I've seen shady♥♥♥♥♥♥ but this level is astronomic, not even Aliens: Colonial Marines, Rome 2, BRINK were this ♥♥♥♥ed up.Don't even dare download this, just don't. Play Fortnite, it costs the same and it's made with love and care and not the most cluter♥♥♥♥ed business practises I've seen.			"

												H1Z1 Timeline: Early Access game Released on Jan 15, 2015 for $20. (Keep this in mind.) People loved it, and it got support.(Sidenote: It goes all downhill from here. Yea. Pretty quick right?) Devs made their BR mode a higher priority instead of their main survival mode (You know, the main draw to the game? Yea. Pretty smart right?) Fast foward. In October 2017, the Devs split the one game into two separate games. (Sure! just split the playerbase in half! they'll still support us! Also, lets make each game $20 while we're at it so we can maybe make more money off this quickly dying game!) Devs rebrand both games so many times it's hard to keep track. (Great for marketing btw). Both games suffered from less people working on them due to less people working on them. Daybreak gives up with communicating with their community. (The only people who still like their game). Games such as Fortnite and PUBG came out which took almost every person away from H1Z1. Daybreak came to the conclusion that they were dying. So what do they do? On February 28, 2018, they made the $20 game, that so many people bought, free.Oh, you thought that's where it ended? yikes! you won't like what you read next. August 24, 2018, the devs for the game ""Just Survive"" (THE ORIGINAL GAME) announce that the game will be discontinued and taken off of steam. The game was never finished and is still in early access. Also, I can't get my refund.FInal Words: I supported Daybreak by purchasing their $20 game. It got split to make more money. One of the games became free, which makes me feel I got scammed. And to top all off, the original game mode is now discontinued and I can't play it even if I wanted to. I paid $20 for actually nothing. Seriously. Never buying a game from Daybreak again. Also, did I mention I can't get refund? "

Early Access Review
								Never have I seen a game fall so far down than H1Z1. This game used to be fun, amazingly fun infact. The hit reg was bearable, the guns felt great and the lighting was great. H1Z1 was the #1 battle royale game for quite sometime.This games worst enemy is its own developers, Daybreak games have ruined what this great game once was. With the additon of the combat update, the gun play and recoil was drasitcally changed for its core guns which left a lot of veteran players infuriated. To give a clear analogy to how bad this recoil change was:Counter Strike (starting from 1.6) has had a VERY similar if not the exact same recoil pattern for the AK-47 for more than a decade and a half. All the core players have got this on lock giving the game a much higher skill gap. Imagine if Valve suddenly decided to completely change the AK-47 spray pattern with no logical reasoning? The outrage would be immense. Daybreak are trying to re invent this game into something that it shouldnt be. It should be what the players want not what the developers want. The players have been screaming to the devs to revert back to the build of a previous season where the game was at its peak, but they dont listen. They say they wont do it and they dont provide any logical reasoning. Now the gunplay is horrid, shotgun is broken, ENAS has plauged the play style and there is little to no skill gap in the game. I really do want this game to prosper and go back to that beautiful game that it once was, but I sadly and firmly believe that it wont ever get close to what it once was purely because of the developers. If you want proof as to why I believe this, have a look at the Steam Charts and the H1Z1 Subreddit. PUBG did not kill H1Z1, Fortnite did not kill H1Z1, the players did not kill H1Z1.Daybreak Games killed H1Z1.And it will never be great again.			"

								Once upon a time there was a not so bad battle royale game called H1Z1, there was some flaws but it was bearable cause the game was addictive. It has been in early access for ages, cause the devs are making it worse every patch. They seem to care way more about skins than improving the game, the only thing they did is implement features from PUBG in reaction from it's success. Also not so long ago, the combat update ruined the game once and for all.So I'm not recommending this game, even on sale for 5$ it's not worth it, unless you don't care about your sanity.RIP H1Z1			"

								This game was sunk by poor customer service as well. I at one point lost years worth of items due to a bug. I was told by one of the devs in an email to ""stop button mashing"". My email was nothing but respect and appreciation for a good game where I also simply asked if they could return my bugged items I have earned over the years. ""Stop Button Mashing""! Really? And now your game is dead. Good work!♥♥♥♥♥♥poor development. Just sad and dissapointed I have over 2k in hours in crap. And yes this game actually is years old it was originally released Jan 2015.

								I've wasted too much time on this game, the devs are too woried about skins then they are about the fluidity of gameplay. They would rather the game look older and play worse, than to fix problems they already have. Maybe they've made steps in the wrong direction, or maybe they don't see the game's path in the same way the players do.

								What makes a game good? Free content? Something we have never played before? Or maybe even developers listening to the community? And what can go wrong?H1Z1 went wrong....Before ""H1Z1"" was...well...""Just Survive"" there was H1Z1. Through here, we had another game were we can travel searching for loot and fandom, making Allies and enemies alike, and simply RDM. For me, it was a train away from the DayZ hype. Heck, before PUBG, it was DayZ VS H1Z1. And it's funny because they all branched from Arma, yet, H1Z1 for some reason stuck out, with their on...Battle-Royal. This would take place in Z1 with over 150+ players. It was 'INSANE'. Jumping over peers, Dolphin Diving, Two bullets to kill, and ""Shotgun rushing."" These few elements kept people on their toes, unless they were getting shot under the car. This started my love for H1Z1. I would practice day and night trying to get high kills. I remember thinking 18 kills was legendary, until I discovered the insane channels like StormenTV, DrDisrespect, Ninja, And even good old LyndonFPS, it was clear to me...I had to get better. I'd practice when my friends were even off, rush everyone, tried copying these top tier gods. If Stormen would no scope someone from med-range I'd practice that, when Doc jumped over the enemies just to one-pump them I'd camp doors for days. When I discovered two-taps, I became a God! But of course things took a twist for the worst!H1Z1 decided to branch out, moving to a new reddit, and making H1Z1 into H1Z1: Kotk. Things started to change without question, losing half the animations that we became so familiar with, removing out-playable situations. Instead of being able to jump over people it like crazy it was nerfed for a more stiff yet set to the ground type character. The odd body removements I remember laughing at everytime I died were gone. And follow was Z2 replacing Z1. This started a whole war inside the H1Z1 community with people picking sides, some vouching for the new maps and others...not too sure. This caused people to beg for Z1, and with Just Survive being introduced it started a uproar for those veterns. However, Pre-season 2 and 3 felt like humble times. The color popped, there was such a shift in skill with the new map. And people began to try and master it all, with people landing in big cities to gear up and camp the roofs while try-hards played Need For Speed while honking their horns. People would either jump out full speed to land insane Two-taps or get one-pumped by a shotgun, roof campers shooting the survivers and window watchers popping out of apartments from left to right. I would remember the rage and joy when people would win in ridiculous ways. I remember I'd shoot someone 5 times with a shotgun and would lose to their one-pump and curse the heathens out of them all! I have even gotten a game ban due to ReShade not being able to be used. I didn't care. I would repurchase H1Z1 and make new friends, Recieve new skins, even able to win a Pig mask and sell it for an upgrade on my GPU. It was my love, my life. And it has failed not only me...but us.As time proceed, we have gotten nothing but updates we didn't ask for, Hit-reg feeling more and more deluted, and players crying that their one pumper-runie didn't do it's job and ending up with them costing their life. We would take a shift into bullet drop changing, making people rage at the fact that they'll have to re-learn, and learn until they are sick of it all.What followed next...is the down fall of H1Z1: KotkWith their ""NEW COMBAT UPDATE!"" At this time, let us face it, PUBG was being hyped by streamers and created a path to a whole new experience. But why would I enjoy that? I remember the barbaric frame-rate and Potato loading buildings, and besides why would I'd like to play a game where after I get nothing but a pistol I get sniped in a mere second? Sticking with H1 was well worth it until this new Combat update. Concerns of the Old Ar-15 pattern being spammable was to be replace with a whole new model of an AR, Bullet drop, Recoil, Spread, and even the look of it was re-worked. The community felt a painful joy. It was all looking gorgeous on paper and by the next week, it was pushed to Test servers. This caused the depression of this game, some were positive while most knew this might be the end of H1Z1. Despite the New Ar, Ak, And new MP7, instead of doing what it was told it was doing the exact opposite! People would spam the Ar, the AK, And lets not forget the lazer, MP7. The game felt even more buggy, There was no bullet drop, barley leading, the Ar, even more spammable at a farther range. I remember spraying the AK and hitting unthinkable two taps. And the community wasn't just raged, but scared for the big changes coming to H1Z1...And it came. With different type of nerfs applied, and almost new everything with a crazy amount of POIs the game started to lose fandom. I remember seeing 9k playings being lost each month, this has started the decline.Seeing ""H1Z1: Kotk"" and ""H1Z1"" Becoming ""H1Z1"" and ""Just Survive"" started the death of the game.With Just Survive having their own problem, H1Z1 originality has started to shift, even ideas of adding scopes, and silencers where brought up with the community shutting it down. With the new Combat Update pros has branched to different games such as PUBG, and later on Fortnite. H1Z1 losing it's hype and slowy dying, each update ruining the game, bringing the fandom to rage. Even though we wanted to try something new it has back fired, with every update being directed by the community being hated afterwards, the game kept digging it's own grave. With all the big names disappearing and H1Z1 searching for the next big update, it was clear to see the direction of this product. Players quitting monthly in persuit for better games, skins losing it's price, and even the China ban hit H1 with many more problems. With only a handful who would stay.Yet, even when they started listening to us at the end, this started the ""Loop."" DayBreak would add something to revert it back, The new Ar replaced with the old spray pattern with adjustments, Z1 being re-worked even they would refuse to ever bringing it back. Movement, like Jumping over people, or Instantly Proning being brought back, things we had which is now making a comeback too late. Why would the aspect of the game change if we'd get them back later on? It didn't make sense, and people saw that. With the progression questionable it was even time for even veterns to finally make their way to better titles.H1Z1 has finally plummeted, The game feels terrible, Movement is restricted, You have to gamble for hit-reg, and games sometime starting up with only 70 players. Waiting went from a few seconds to a few minutes. It was starting to feel deserted. The same faces each game and less of them daily. and with the last change to bullet drop and couldn't take it anymore. I've lost all the knowladge I've learned, the old me has vanished, and even new players would consider me as a noob. It was clear to see, that my time has come aswell.Turning back at the times I've spent hiding from teams, crafting make-shifts, and popping off helments, made me realize that I might never feel such a rush for action, such a thrill shift in gameplay, and the funny jolts that I'd spend with friends. It's very clear to me, DayBreak has pulled a Planetside 2 on me, This was the 2nd time I've felt such a big lost in such an odd community. The shifting of games isn't even just for me. I really can never feel the same compared to what I've gone through in Z1 and Z2. And I feel many have felt the same, we all held hope for the game to jump back just to see it fall down each leap, and with the current state being worked on just to meet the need of the now player base I cannot recommend this game. I'd always have my saved videos...but will never have the same game in them. "

												H1Z1 is a dead game, murdered by it’s own developers.I’m not here to demand my money back. This game was once fun a full of promise so I have no problem with the fact that I paid full price for it. You see, that’s how it’s supposed to go. Early access is a kind of a system where gamers support a clearly unfinished product out of the love for games and the developers in turn honor that support by trying to use those funds to better the product as well as they possibly can.This is not what happened with H1Z1.Daybreak noticed way too early that pushing out ridiculous amounts of items gave them a nice extra revenue, not only from crate/key sales but also from gamers juggling those items back and forth at the marketplace (yes, they get a cut).The shift from building an interesting game to building a moneymaking machine was clear as day. Instead of bettering the game, updates concentrated on how to get more players to play → buy crates → buy and sell items. The lack of love is so apparent in the development of this game that it leaves me and all my friends wondering if the developers are actually gamers themselves at all.I got this game very soon after the launch and played regularly over the years. I watched a fun functional game turn into a monotonic mess. Let’s look at the changes / functions closer:Normal Battle Royale:- When the game first got out, it had a good interesting map with a lot of foliage and natural formations. This allowed players to have more than one strategy. This is the only time when the items they sold were useful because you could actually take advantage of things like camo. Soon the developers cut the map’s size, removed almost all the interesting places and pretty much all the foliage. This was no doubt a way to cater to an audience with cheaper computers. The end result is horrible: nothing but open level fields without foliage or even rocks to take cover behind. In a way it looks like a 12 year old’s first attempt at making a map in Unity using nothing but free store assets. The map looks unprofessional and is boring to play in.- Let’s mention this again. There is only 1 map.- Guns used to feel steady. Now the recoil is like everyone is missing an arm. As someone who has handled multiple different firearms in her life I can tell that it doesn’t work like this.- The original way of fighting but also having to worry about the location of the safe zone was more interesting and actually required some brains to do. Now they added all sorts of ease-of-access map markers to make sure anyone with 50IQ or less can just spawn into the safe zone and pew pew pew / repeat.- There’s only one way to play. Because of the emptiness of the map and the safe zone always concentrating on an open level field, the only way to survive is to get a car and keep moving. On foot you never have a place to hide behind and end up being shot down in seconds by someone with a car. This wasn’t the case before, using a car was only one of the multiple ways you could approach winning the match.- Cheaters. This problem got a lot worse after the game went ftp.- Desync.- Annoying things like grenade blasts and gas grenade gas passing walls / floors.- Again, cars. They used to be rare. This was nice because it forced people to play in more than just one way. Now cars are literally everywhere, it takes less than a minute for a 5-person team to have a vehicle for every person.- People don’t play. Trying to play fives after 1AM in EU is borderline impossible because the lobby has less than 5 teams.Car Royale:Note that this would be a really fun mode if it actually worked.- Desync.- Getting stuck on walls / railings.- Duos never available.- Takes forever to start a match.- Impossible to start a match after 1AM due to no-one playing this game.- A griefer’s heaven. Why? There is no vote kick or any way to lock a spot on your team. If you have the misfortune to not actually have 4 people available to play, you are at the mercy of the 1 random person who gets matched with your team forcibly. This one person has a multitude of ways to screw over the team: stealing all healing items, using molotovs to set your own team’s car on fire, using grenades to hurt your own team’s car, using mines to hurt your own team, using the crossbow or the rpg to hurt your own team or (and this is the best part) getting angry over not getting a special weapon like the crossbow and taking the ammo into his own inventory even if someone else has the crossbow. Note that the person who actually has the weapon cannot take the ammo into their own inventory and use it, only the ones without the weapon can take it and make it unavailable for the person who has it. If the randomer ends up as the driver he has plenty of new ways to troll. These people are more common than you’d think and seem to be playing this mode solely for this purpose.- The unwinnable match. If you play 10 matches, about 3-4 out of those matches are unwinnable by default. Not because of the skill of your team but because of the system not registering the destruction of a team if they have a 2000ping ftp player connecting while they died. This leads to you being alone in the safe zone with no-one to kill, yet the system says there is still one person/team alive besides you.- The 2000 ping players. Again, there is no vote kick or any way to get this person off your team. If you play with 2 friends 8 times out of 10 your last team mate is this person. Why is it a problem then? I’ll tell you. After you spawn, you need to change the driver if your team has a person that always drives. But if someone is still connecting, you cannot change the seats. Odds are you end up driving around half the match with the randomer still connecting. Again one of those awesome things brought to us by making the game ftp.- The quality of the player base. I didn’t mention this on the normal Battle Royale because it’s not a bother there but in Car Royale it is. Team games are a great way to meet new gamers like yourself, make friends and hone your teamwork skills. This game has nothing but ftp players left. This means people without steam profiles, microphones, teamwork skills or even the ability to connect into the match.The game has been going downhill for a long time due to many of the reasons I’ve stated above and people have spoken out. Just look at the reviews (even before the game went ftp).And how does Daybreak answer the gamers? By reverting back to the old map? No. By changing the shooting mechanics back to how they used to be? No. They answer by releasing more items. And crates. And hoodies that cost 16 euros. And Weapon skins that cost 10 euros. Daybreak will never get another cent from me. Disrespecting your own game and your player base like this is like disrespecting the entire gamer culture. Gamers can see when a developer develops for the money and not for the love of the game. And this is why this game is dead. Time to move on. "

												After almost spending my entire life (almost 1000 hours, including the original H1Z1) here is my final review for you guys.It all began 2015, where the glorious H1Z1 has been released. At this time the game was full of bugs, well I didn't judge in those days, because it was an Early-Access-Version of the game.Though it had a lot of bugs, it was really fun to play, with friends of course.At this time you actually were getting rewards for winning, even if you were playing in a group. Nowadays you will not get rewarded after winning when playing with a group. So for some people (including me), the motivation to win was missing, since those days.After the Developer Studio switched and reorganized from Sony Online Entertainment to Daybreak Games (TheyBreak Games     ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) ) the game was on their way to fall down.You couldn't see any progress in developing, major bugs existed for months, the priority list of Daybreak Games was disastrous. Well though I had those bad impressions, I wasn't missing the fun at this time. In 2016 they made the decision split the game into two. H1Z1: Just Survive and H1Z1: King of the Kill. I had hope in the developement of this game again, because I thought maybe it will help them to organize themselfs better and to set priorities.On one side I was happy that they brought some new stuff, new gamemodes to play, events, etc., like Ignition, Skirmish, Green Dawn, Hardcore, but on the other side major bugs still existed. But for me, it was still fun to play.Later 2016 they have made their biggest mistake. They (re)-""launched"" their game (fun-fact: its still in early-access) and promised a major change in gameplay, graphics, performance and developing. So let's see what the ""launch"" brought us:(1) They have removed the old map and replaced it with the new Z2-Map. You might ask yourself now, what, is so bad about the new Z2-Map?:- Though they promised graphic enhancements, they've just increased the color saturation, to pretend, that graphics are better now. But as you might guess: They are not even close to better. The lightnings in the buildings are worse then ever. You can hardly see the loot inside of the buildings.- The actual reason for why the map was changed was that the devs thought, that the original map was maybe a bit too much copy and pasted. Here is my opionion on that: The new map is even more copy and pasted. Almost every buildings looks the same.- There are no real memorial places or fighting spots, like they were on the original map. Maybe it is because that I am a little bit nostalgic, but people who have played the original H1Z1 will understand me, when I rave about PV Police-Station, Radio-Tower, Opfer Camp, Reservoir Dam, B2, Hospital, etc, etc...- Loot is clipping inside of the textures so you cannot pick it up. This bug exists since almost half a year now.- Floating trees and ugly streets and textures are daily fare.- They won't give us the opportunity to play the old map, since they ""deleted it by mistake"" so they said. (Another fun-fact: the old map is still available in H1Z1: JS, so there is no way that it had been deleted)- There is no pit in the new Box of Destiny. Where the hell shall summit go then?(2) They have made a major change to the Interface and the HUD, which in my eyes clearly looks fancier but is actually worse than the original, because it seems really unclearly to me.(3) The translations are actually worse than google translator.(4) They have removed previous exlusive gamemodes, so you can't play them anymore. Well there is the ability to do so, but there never had been an event where you can play them.(5) They brought in a new rewards system and removed the old one. Unfortunatley, I never could experience those, because as you might noticed, I was always playing with friends. But nope, there are still no rewards for groups.(6) The performance is still as bad as in the old H1Z1.You might ask yourself now, why did they make those changes and why did they relaunch the game?Clear answer boys: to market the game more efficient.I have lost faith in this game and thats why I felt the need to write this review.I have the bad feeling that this game won't get any better, since the problem-solving approaches from the developers are slow, less efficient and mostly alternative and do not treat the cause of most problems.Edit: _______When the game was fun - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlvQDVWNsmgI will always remember you Z1. <3Shame on you greedy devs! Memories will stay, but you will fade._______Got the ""Dying Game Award"".Lel._______""iT'S bEcAuSE oF pUbG aNd FoRtnIte ThAT tHE pLaYeRbaSE iS LoWeRINg""			"

								1661.4 hrs. I know what i'm talking about.Imagine you buy a nice dog (h1z1) for your birthday. You love this dog, you play with it almost every day, and the dog loves you back. After a few months you decide your current doghouse isn't big enough anymore to keep your dog in, so you buy an expensive, nicely painted doghouse (brand new pc) JUST to play with this dog. Another few months go by, and you start noticing all the things you don't like about your loyal companion anymore. His fur is all scruffy, his teeth are going yellow, and he barks at the first sign of another human being. You try to convince yourself your dog is changing, growing up. Little do you know every time you try to play with your dog it attacks you and starts growling at you. Every single week you notice different changes to your dog. He starts walking funny, his barks sound like guinnea pigs having coïtus and the once beautiful fur has all but vanished. You now try to play with a mean, broken, sorry♥♥♥♥♥excuse of a dog every single day in the last hope he may one day become the beautiful creature he once was.

								I had +220 hours on H1Z1 before it was split. I will tell you what: The concept of BR was good. It was quick, full of people, very competitive, always gave you that rush. It was good for alpha, but then you started to notice something. - The map sucks. Its like if you had spent 2 hours on far cry 2 editor. No details at all. Same ♥♥♥♥♥♥ vegetation brush everywhere. - 3 main weapons: shotgun, ar15 and ak47. So poor.- Queues to play. Such long queues. Was it that expensive to buy more servers? Oh wait...thats what the next point kicks right in.- Developers only care about money. For real. Updates only had small fixes like ""ak now is a bit less powerful"" or ""car speed reduced"" and all the rest was about 100 ♥♥♥♥♥♥ skins for which you have to buy keys and crates. Its such a rip off. Its an alpha game, for ♥♥♥♥s sake, and they charge you like millions for skins. Winning battle royale only gives you horrible loot which is absolutely worthless, because, of course, they do not want you to get cool content by winning and proving yourself to be good, no, they want you to spend more moneyz in their alpha game which will never be completed except for the fantastic crate&key system. They even have their in-game money. Why? So they can control the price of keys. It would be fatal for them if people could sell keys or crates.Its so disgusting to see that as soon as they get some fame, they instantly forget about the game and start looking for all kinds of ideas to rip you off. It bothered me so hard that my ingame name in DayZ SA is ""H1Z1Sucks"".Seriously, only buy this game if all you care is about BUYING content that otherwise you would get for free. In addition (but last) their ♥♥♥♥in brilliant bussinessmen came up with the idea of splitting the game in two, so that instead of having one alpha game with two game modes, they had 2 broken alpha games for each 20€. And the worst is, they tried to make us believe it was because ""they wanted to focus more"". Oh, and as I write I remember another thing, the ""Green Battle royal"" or whatever it was called. They realised people only played for the BR mode, so they thought ""Hey, could we charge them for playing BR mode? Oh yea we can, but lets disguise it as a new mode with extra luxury weapon skins"". Then you win the br green and you check your AR15 skin and realise they only put 30 seconds in sprayin some green ♥♥♥♥♥♥ brush over the model. ♥♥♥♥in brilliant.			"

								What was originally supposed to be a 1000 man zombie survival game on the scale of Planetside 2 (same engine) and was bought from Sony and gutted by Day Break then instantly ""finished."" I bought into H1Z1 for what it was originally supposed to be, a horror survival game; then it became an arcade shooter to turn a quick profit for another company not even involved in it's production. Once I learnt of their ill treatment of Player-Unknown, that was the only semblance of silver lining that came out of the Day Break tragedy... If they never bought out his parent company and fired him we never would have PUBG. So. I guess we can thank them for giving us PUBG as he took the money he made from H1Z1 and the Sony sale and made PUBG as a giant flipping of the bird to Day Break.			"

								H1Z1 is a game I've played for over a year and a game that I've loved a lot for such a long time. It was a game that I was willing to look past the bugs and poor development team because of how much fun I had playing this game. The current state of the game, on April 11 2017, is absolutely terrible. We've been promised so many things and been given so little. We just NOW got a spectator camera. 9/10 of my games are ruined by a hacker two tapping me from a mountain. Despite all of this, I loved King of the Kill so much. I made so many friends and got close to so many people through this game, and it held a special place in my heart for that. Until today.My best friend got on to play a couple of rounds with me only to find out that she had been banned. Why, might you ask? Well neither of us have any idea whatsoever! She's not someone to care about cheating or even her rank all that much, seeing as we only played duos and fives. All of her games were very low kill counts and placings, if anything she was a very average player around Gold level. She never had an insane performance or anything like that. Today, she was banned by Daybreak Games for virtually no reason. I can not, with a clean conscience, recommend ANYBODY to purchase this game or give the developer any of your money whatsoever.Daybreak Games is a terrible company in literally every single right. The game has been early access for three years and the game has gone nowhere at all.Edit: Daybreak responded to my friend's complaint about being unreasonable banned with:""nullnullThanks!don't reply."":)			"

								A perfect battle royale game killed by combat update which was released August 10th 2017. This game was slowly deminishing after pre-season 3 but the useless, pathetic and incompetant devs failed to see that. The development team have a mindset that ""If we make it like PUBG, we will get more players"" but what's the point when I can just play PUBG instead.Countless players that have enjoyed playing this game enough to accumulate over 1000 hours are being ignored. One of the Combat Update features was making bullet drop non existant which just throws all that time and effort learning this game down the drain.This was my favourite game and I used to be excited to play it... This game has come so far downhill which is just sad.  Do not play this game at all cost until the devs stick to the true H1Z1 gameplay.			"

								Having played a lot of Battle Royal in H1Z1 (before they split the game), I can say this game mode is pretty fun. But, it is just ONE game mode. So, ask yourself if it is worth buying a 20€ game for just ONE gamemode, a gamemode previously part of another game!?-----Daybreak claims that they will be adding more gamemodes, but that's yet to be seen. We don't know what gamemodes or how many will be added. Reading the early acces page they claim to add additional gamemodes and game rules. Judging the history of this game/development, I would not be supprised if they only add slight variations of the ONE gamemode Battle Royal.Before the split, there already where 3 variants of this game mode, you had one without zombies, one with zombies and one with special rewards for winning! This last mode was behind a cash wall and you need to buy tickets for real hard cash to join this mode.Technicly they could say they have 3 gamemodes. Then you have the same game with team of 2, or team of 5 players. So there you have it, 5 gamemodes! :PWe have to wait and see what the new gamemodes are, if any are added!Ask yourself, knowing this, is ONE gamemode still worth 20€?-----Let's inform you some more, because this game has a rocky history with many claims that never became reality!They ones claimed to NEVER add pay2win mechanics to this game, then airdrops where added to survival mode that gave you food, water, weapons and ammo! Airdrops are behind a paywall from real hard cash! Though they changed the way this works but still ...They claimed this game would become free2play ones released. Guess what, it's 20€ with additional supply crates and cosmatic microtransactions! Even payed gamemodes like the Battle Royal variant (Green Dawn) and airdrops for ingame loot.Again, ask yourself, is this game worth 20€, with possible new gamemodes behind cash wall, with micro transactions and many broken promises?Then the worst part, the recent split of H1Z1 into two games. This game, King of the Kill, was part of the original H1Z1. You had survival servers and Battle Royal servers! Now you have the survival game, 20€ and the battle royal game for another 20€! And what would happen if say a new gamemode is added to King of the Kill, which becomes very popular, will they split agian? Who knows!?This split would not be the worst of things, if they cut the price in half. Would be fair since they cut the game in half but nope, now you pay 2x20€ for something that ones was 1x20€, for something that ones was promised to be free2play!Also, remember you now need to pay double for microtransactions. Getting a new piece of clothing from a microtransaction was universal availible for all servers and gamemodes. Now, if you want that same piece of clothing be prepared to buy the same item twice!!!Knowing all of this, ask yourself is ONE gamemode worth 20€?-----With this out of the way you might want to know if this ONE gamemode is fun and yes, I said I have lots of fun with this gamemode. So let's get into that!You spawn with around 150 other players on a large open map. Everyone drops down from the sky with a parasute. It's now time to land as fast as you can, so you can be the first to loot weapons, ammo, backpacks and more. So you can be the first to blast others in the face.After a few minutes a savezone is drawn on your map, because toxic fog will be released and slowly drive you towards the savezone. This mechanic is fun and usefull to drive the remaining players towards the same spot.Though there is only ONE map it's big enough to be fun for a long time. Mainly because a lot of things are random. Not the map itself but your spawn location is random, weapon spawns are random and the savezones are random. One match ends in an urban location and another on top of the mountains.All seems good, but there is also a lot wrong with the game and it's mechanics!Spawning for example! You don't spawn at the same time as your enemies. It depends on your loading time, internet connection and random bad luck (sometimes the game takes 2 or 3 times longer to load). This means people with faster hardware and internet connection land faster, getting guns fasters and thus have an increased change to win!Next problem is that hitbox detection and netcode are so random. With a bit of bad luck you can shoot somebody in the head for multiple times without them dieing. While other times you one hit kill them.Same with the shotgun, it's spread pattern is random. So you can almost get sniped from long distance with a shotgun while other times you can't hit/kill somebody at close range! And it's all luck, or badluck depending how it ends!On top of that there aren't many weapons and in the end it comes down to AR15 for long range, shotgun for close range. Perhaps the AK47 (though it got nerved) or if you are lucky the hunting rifle (sniper that only drops from airdrops). All the other weapons are just useless compared to the above, so bows, crossbows and pistols are ignored! You only use them if they are the first weapon you can find early game.-----Eventhough this gamemode is a lot of fun, even with all it's flaws, I can't recommend it to anyone! Specially knowing that this ONE gamemode was part of another game!Perhaps if they fix the core issues (spawning, hitbox detection, etc) and add more gamemodes AND lower the price to 10€ or less, then and only then it might become worth it!For now, it's a big NO NO. Not recommended!			"
